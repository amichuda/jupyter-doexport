======================
Stata Do File Exporter
======================


Stata Do File Exporter provides a context menu and template for exporting a jupyter notebook with Stata kernel, to a do-file with all markdown and code ready to be executed at the Stata GUI or console.

To install the exporter, write:

``pip install jupyter-doexporty``

Your jupyter notebook should not be available for export from the  ``File ->  Download as`` menu.

Currently, translation of stata_kernel magics are not supported.
